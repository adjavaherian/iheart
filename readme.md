# iHeart

This is a partially working example of a Express /React / Redux application.  I didn't get a chance to work on the API portion of the express server, but you can imagine how that might work when you hit an endpoint, fetch artists and return a promise that can be used to populate the store and refresh the reducer with new artists from a search.  Also, there is an example of a responsive layout design that doesn't need to query the viewport to achieve the desired results.

## Run Dev Example

`cd iheart && npm install && gulp develop`
